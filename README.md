# SortingLibrary
Implementations of several sorting algorithms, with unit testing, measuring of execution time vs data set size, with output to csv.

This code is not polished, i.e. I rushed to witness the graphs of time complexity in excel.

My implementations of Bubblesort and Selection sort are compared with the Array.Sort() method which uses the Introsort.

Tests are made with xUnit.
